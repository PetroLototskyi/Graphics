Python skills are in high demand, and programmers who demonstrate real-world skill in building applications are highly sought after. In this course, Megan Silvey shows you how to take real-life programming problems and turn them into actionable results through building three different practical applications. These applications focus on working with popular Python topics: web scraping, web APIs, and text analysis. Check out this course to improve your skills and build applications that you can show off to potential employers.
This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace.



## File Structure
There is one branch for this course containing three chapter folders corresponding to the three chapters in the course. Inside these chapter folders are the coding exercise files. The naming convention for the exercise files is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 

All coding exercise files will have a beginning and an end state, for example '02_03e' would be the ending file for the third movie in the second chapter. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` file contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` file contains the code as it is at the end of the movie.
